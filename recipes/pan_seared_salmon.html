        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This pan seared salmon is easy and tasty. I don't like cooking, but I really like eating, so this recipe strikes a nice balance between 
            not having to spend a lot of time cooking, but the end result is really good. Also, this picture I found looks really good, but it's massive.
